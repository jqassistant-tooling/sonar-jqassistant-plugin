= jQAssistant SonarQube Plugin

This is the SonarQube plugin for jQAssistant integration

== Requirements

* SonarQube 9.9 or higher
* Java project with jQAssistant setup

== Installation

=== SonarQube Marketplace

* Login into SonarQube as administrator and navigate to `Administration`/`MarketPlace`
* Enter `jQAssistant` in the filter panel, click `Install` and restart the SonarQube server

=== Manual

* https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.jqassistant.contrib.sonarqube[Download] the plugin JAR for your SonarQube release
* Copy the plugin (i.e. JAR file) to the `extensions/plugins` folder of the SonarQube installation
* (Re-)Start the SonarQube server

== Configuration

The plugin provides two rules that need to be activated for the quality profile of your project(s).

Constraint Violation::
Constraints that reported violations (default severity: Major).
Invalid Concept::
Concepts that are defined but could not be applied successfully (default severity: Minor).

Therefore the following steps need to be performed in the SonarQube UI (as administrator):

* Navigate to `Quality Profiles`
* Select your desired quality profile
* Activate the jQAssistant rules
** Open the view to manage the rules of the quality profile
** Search for inactive rules in the repository `jQAssistant` (by using the filters on the left side)
** Activate the desired rules
* Add your project to the quality profile (if not already done)
** Navigate back to the overview screen of the selected quality profile
** Select `Projects`
** Add your project

.Supported properties
|===
| Property                     | Description                                         | Default value
| sonar.jqassistant.disabled   | Disable the jQAssistant sensor.                     | false
| sonar.jqassistant.reportPath | The path to the jQAssistant XML report file, either absolute or relative to the module directory | <projectRoot>/target/jqassistant/jqassistant-report.xml
| sonar.jqassistant.issueType  | Determines the type of created issues, available options are `CODE_SMELL`, `BUG`, `VULNERABILITY` or `SECURITY_HOTSPOT`  | `CODE_SMELL`
|===

NOTE: By specifying a relative `reportPath` the first jQAssistant XML report file will be used for a module in a multi-module structure
which can be found by traversing the module hierarchy upwards until the project's root directory is reached.

== Execution

In case of a Maven project with a jQAssistant setup the following steps need to be executed:

`mvn verify`::
  Build the project including scan and analysis by jQAssistant.
  A file `target/jqassistant/jqassistant-report.xml` will be created containing an XML report.
`mvn sonar:sonar`::
  Run the SonarQube analysis.
  The sensor of the jQAssistant SonarQube plugin will evaluate the report and create issues for failed rules.

== Example Setup

This section describes an example setup for a Maven project with the following structure:

.Example Maven Project
[source,raw]
----
project/
  pom.xml      <1>
  jqassistant/ <2>
    index.adoc
  src/
    main/
      java/
----
<1> Maven build descriptor containing the jQAssistant setup.
<2> The directory where jQAssistant searches for project specific rules (`.adoc` or `.xml` files)

For executing jQAssistant during the build the jQAssistant Maven plugin must be configured in the file `pom.xml`:

./pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<project>
...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>com.buschmais.jqassistant</groupId>
        <artifactId>jqassistant-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${jqassistant-maven-plugin.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <goals>
              <goal>scan</goal>
              <goal>analyze</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
        <configuration>
          <warnOnSeverity>MINOR</warnOnSeverity>
          <failOnSeverity>CRITICAL</failOnSeverity>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
...
</project>
----

Project specific rules are loaded from the directory `jqassistant`.

The following example contains a group `default` which is automatically executed by jQAssistant.
It includes the constraint `model:JpaEntityLocation` that is defined in the same document and verifies that all JPA entities are located in packages called `model`.
Therefore the constraint relies on a pre-defined concept `jpa2:Entity` which adds a label `Entity` to all classes that are annotated with `javax.persistence.Entity`.

./jqassistant/index.adoc
[source,adoc]
....

= Project Rules

This document describes coding guide lines for the project.

[[default]]                                      <1>
[role=group,includesConstraints="model:JpaEntityLocation"]
== Continuous Integration Rules

The following rules are executed during a CI build:

* <<model:JpaEntityLocation>>

== JPA Model

[[model:JpaEntityLocation]]                      <2>
.All JPA entities must be located in a package with the name "model"
[source,cypher,role=concept,requiresConcepts="jpa2:Entity",primaryReportColumn="EntityInWrongPackage"]
----
MATCH
  (package:Package)-[:CONTAINS]->(entity:Entity:Class)
WHERE
  package.name <> "model"
RETURN
  package as Package, entity as EntityInWrongPackage
----
....
<1> Defines the group `default` that includes the constraint
<2> Defines the constraint `model:JpaEntityLocation` that relies on the concept `jpa2:Entity`

NOTE: The constraint defines a property called `primaryReportColumn`.
It specifies the column of the result containing the elements (e.g. classes, packages) which shall be used to create issues in SonarQube.
The property is optional, if omitted the first column is used by default (recommended).

== From jQAssistant queries to SonarQube issues

In the following we're describing some best practises of the usage of jQAssistant in combination with the SonarQube jQAssistant plugin.

The following example describes a method invocation from a class of the persistence layer to a class of the core layer.

[source,cypher]
MATCH
    (persistenceClass:Class:Persistence) -[:DECLARES]-> (persistenceMethod:Method)
        -[invocation:INVOKES]->
    (coreMethod:Method) <-[:DECLARES]- (coreClass:Class:Core)


We're now comparing three different examples of possible return values and their jQA report results which are
the base of processing new Sonar issues.

When you build you project with `mvn clean verfiy` jQA will execute all the rules you provided and generate the file `jqassistant-report.xml`.
This report is evaluated by the Sonar jQAssistant plugin to generate Sonar issues.
The plugin processes the report file.
For each contained violation the value of the `primary report column` of the rule (i.e. or first if not specified) is used
to generate an issue on the matching element (e.g. class, method, field, etc.) in SonarQube.
The values of the other columns are used to provide additional information.

In the following you three example of possible primary return values are provided:

1.) RETURN persistenceClass.name

[source,xml]
    <result>
        <columns count="3">
            <column primary="true">persistenceClass.name</column>
        </columns>
        <rows count="1">
            <row>
                <column name="persistenceClass.name">
                    <value>AnyPersistenceClass</value>
                </column>
            </row>
        </rows>
    </result>

2.) RETURN coreclass

[soruce,xml]
    <result>
        <columns count="1">
            <column primary="true">coreClass</column>
        </columns>
        <rows count="1">
            <row>
                <column name="coreClass">
                    <element language="Java">Type</element>
                    <source name="org/jqassistant/example/core/AnyCoreClass.class"></source>
                    <value>org/jqassistant/example/core/InvokedCoreMethod</value>
                </column>
            </row>
        </rows>
    </result>

3.) RETURN i

[source,xml]
    <result>
        <columns count="1">
            <column primary="true">invocation</column>
        </columns>
        <rows count="1">
            <row>
              <column name="invocation">
                <element language="Java">MethodInvocation</element>
                <source name="/org/jqassistant/example/persistence/AnyPersistenceClass.class" line="64"></source>
                <value>org/jqassistant/example/persistence/AnyPersistenceClass#java.util.List coreMethodInvocation(java.lang.Long), line 64</value>
              </column>
            </row>
        </rows>
    </result>

It can bee seen third variant is the one providing most detailed information.
In this case the return value is the whole relationship between the persistence and core class.
